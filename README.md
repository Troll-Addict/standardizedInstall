# **ALL POSSIBLE DEPLOYMENT SOLUTIONS**
## __Requirements for all solutions__
- Ports to/from the kit IP are open on any firewalls between endpoints and the kit
    - [List of ports]
- All install media should be loaded on the kit and an external device (A device we're prepared to lose)
---

## Possible Method types
- Method A: We're given domain credentials
- Method B: We're loaned a system administrator with domain credentials
- Method C: We are asked to provide install files and MP team will accomplish

## GPO
- Method A1:
    - Windows Systems
        - Install GPO to push all install files and scripts to machines from the Sysvol folder
            - We need an exported GPO [XML] to import
        - Run the GPO and ensure there is a restart scheduled within an acceptable timeframe or push a restart after coordinating with MP
        - Verify installs, fill in any gaps in install with PowerShell or Direct Remoting
            - Only after conducting troubleshooting and investigating why installation failed
    - Linux Systems
        - If the linux system can be added to the domain
            - Recommend "Active Directory Bridge" by BeyondTrust
            - Install AD Bridge and add Linux Systems to the domain in order to utilize domain credentials
            - Install across linux systems with a bash script utilizing domain credentials
        - If the linux system can NOT be added to the domain
            - We can run a bash script given appropriate local credentials on the linux machines
            - We can provide a bash script to install locally for system administrators to accomplish
            - We can install manually via commands if given access
